<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

On opening the application you will be presented with the home page. Read through the description of Titan Echo at your leisure. Read through the disclaimer <b>carefully</b>. You are directed to sign up for a Magic wallet account (feel free to use the same email as you do for SX.Bet but note that this does create a different wallet with a different address). The account registration is simple and involves confirmation emails. 

Once logged in you will be presented with the dashboard where you can view and create strategies. 

***Before exploring strategies you must read the quickstart guide found in the top right corner.***

Once you have completed all steps of the quickstart guide, you are now free to create strategies! The strategy creation page has information boxes for all sections. 

***Important reminder: If you feel unsure of the platform at any point, simply delele all strageies and delete all orders.***

***YOU MUST READ THE NEXT SECTION ON WARNINGS.***

<!-- WARNINGS -->
## Warnings

Please read the below warnings and details very carefully. These involve application-breaking points which may lose you money unless properly followed. 

1. Open a new wallet for Titan Echo (the same email address is fine, but not the same public address) ***Do not use the same wallet you use for SX.Bet.***

2. You must keep the application open in your browser window.

3. You must keep the application active in your browser by loading the tab at least once an hour. Note that this varies by browser and operating system. 

4. Do not add or delete orders via the SX.Bet website. Only add or delete orders through the Titan Echo dashboard. Individual orders cannot be cancelled, only all orders in a given strategy. 

5. Titan Echo only echoes Money Line bets (not Spread or Total). 

6. You must regularly visit this GitHub page and redownload the repo to ensure your algorithm is doing what it should (especially important whilst this product is so early).

7. ***PLEASE DO NOT PUT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY ( >$2k) IN THIS APPLICATION - IT IS STILL IN TESTING.***
